# Jobby — Claude Code Context

## What Jobby Is
AI-powered job application automation system. Personal use only for now.
Target: reduce per-application time from 20-30 mins to under 60 seconds.

## Current Phase
**V2 — Chrome Extension + Autofill** (active)
- V1 → AI Resume Tailoring ✅ complete
- V3 → Playwright browser automation + cron job scraper
- V4 → Dashboard + analytics

---

## Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js, Express
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude — model `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, temp `0.15` (migrated off Groq llama-3.3 on 2026-05-24; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`)

> ⚠️ **NAMING — READ ONCE, NEVER RE-LITIGATE:** the file `groqService.js`, the env-var-history mention of
> `GROQ_API_KEY`, and any "Groq" wording in this doc are **legacy from before the 2026-05-24 migration**.
> Everything AI runs on **Claude via `@anthropic-ai/sdk` using `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**. There is NO Groq
> dependency and NO `GROQ_API_KEY` in use. The filename was deliberately kept (it's the "single source of
> truth" import in `tailor.js` + `apply.js`); **rename is a decided deferral, not an open question** — see
> the 2026-05-23 DECISION entry in `DEVLOG.md`. Don't burn a session "discovering" this again.
- **PDF:** Puppeteer + Chromium
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage, bucket `Resumes` (capital R)
- **Process manager:** PM2
- **VPS:** Hetzner, Ubuntu, root access (root@178.105.161.45)
- **Deployment:** Local → GitHub → SSH → git pull → pm2 restart

## Architecture Rules
- `resumeData` in `groqService.js` is the **single source of truth** for all resume content.
  PDF generation, future dashboard, and extension all consume it from here. Never duplicate it.
- The pipeline is always: Claude tailoring → PDF generation → Supabase upload → return signed URL
- Each step has its own service file. Routes only orchestrate — no business logic in `tailor.js`
- Activities/Leadership section is static — Claude does not tailor it, pdfService renders it directly

---

## Naming Conventions

### Files & Folders
- Service files: `camelCase` + `Service.js` suffix — e.g. `groqService.js`, `pdfService.js`
- Route files: flat noun — e.g. `tailor.js`, future: `scraper.js`, `autofill.js`
- Template files: flat noun — e.g. `resume.html`
- Future extension files go in `extension/`
- Future Playwright/cron files go in `automation/`

### Functions
- Builder functions (pdfService): `build` prefix — e.g. `buildSkillsBlock()`, `buildExperienceBlock()`
- Service entry points: verb + noun — e.g. `tailorResume()`, `generateResumePdf()`, `uploadResume()`
- Prompt builders: `buildPrompt()`

### Variables
- Structured data objects: descriptive nouns — `resumeData`, `tailored`, `pdfBuffer`
- HTML chunks: `*Html` suffix — e.g. `bulletHtml`, `stackLine`
- Always destructure at the top of functions — don't dot-chain deep inline

---

## Comment Style
- **Section dividers:** `// ─── Section Name ───...` (use the box-drawing dash, not regular dash)
- **Inline comments:** one space after `//`, sentence case, no period
  - Good: `// required on Linux VPS`
  - Bad: `//required on linux vps.`
- **Block explanations** (above a function or non-obvious block): one line max, explains *why* not *what*
  - Good: `// Puppeteer launch is expensive, fail fast if template is missing`
  - Bad: `// This checks if the file exists`
- **TODO comments:** `// TODO: short description` — keep them specific
- **Never leave commented-out code** unless it has a `// TODO:` explaining why it's kept

---

## Prompt Rules (groqService.js)
These are non-negotiable — never relax them:
1. Never invent bullets, roles, companies, or metrics
2. Never change any number — preserve exactly as written
3. `skillsToAdd` = clean tool names only. No compound phrases, no descriptors.
   Banned suffixes: "design", "workflow", "management", "RESTful", "practices", "principles"
4. Bullets reworded only — keywords woven into the middle, never appended as "and..." clauses at the end
5. Summary = max 2 sentences, one real metric, no filler words
6. Warnings = max 4 items, max 12 words each

---

## Active Issues (V1)
- Claude (the tailoring model) still appending "and..." keyword clauses to bullet ends — prompt needs to be harder on this
- Resume still spilling to 2 pages on some JDs — padding/font tuning ongoing

---

### Session Anchors (read these first when picking up)
Two complementary records — keep both current:
- **This "Last Session Cutoff"** = the *snapshot*: where we are right now + what's next. Overwrite it each
  session so it never goes stale (it had drifted badly before — claimed "uncommitted" / "not implemented"
  for work that had shipped).
- **`DEVLOG.md`** = append-only *post-mortems*: one entry per bug/saga — symptom, root cause, the dead
  ends (the stuff git can't tell you), the fix + commit, and verification status. Add an entry whenever a
  non-trivial bug is chased down. Never edit old entries; append follow-ups. Newest on top.
- `git log` is the diff; **Active Issues (V1)** above is the open-bug list. DEVLOG is the *why*, not a
  changelog duplicate.

### Last Session Cutoff
**Date:** 2026-05-24 (late — supersedes the earlier same-day "combobox cascade" cutoff; that work is now
committed and iterated past where those notes left it). **HEAD = `54fdb7c` "comboboxes 96%". Working tree
clean, up to date with `origin/main`.**

**STATUS: autofill runs end-to-end on live Greenhouse.** One run fills: adapter text fields → resume
upload → react-select dropdowns (single **and** async type-ahead location) → AI/local field resolution →
consent-checkbox ticking. Submit is never clicked (dry-run by design). Full per-bug post-mortem for the
combobox saga lives in `DEVLOG.md`.

**What landed since the prior cutoff** (these notes used to say "uncommitted" / "not implemented" /
"deferred" — all now committed in `c1369a9` → `54fdb7c`):
- **Combobox cascade — FIXED & committed.** Root cause: the *fill* phase read the WRONG menu per field.
  `#country` (intl-tel-input phone chip) filled first, left its menu stuck open → later comboboxes failed
  to open → `findComboboxMenu`'s document-wide fallback returned the stuck 244-option COUNTRY menu →
  blank/garbage (picked "Lebanon" as a phone code). Fix: `findComboboxMenu` resolves ONLY via
  `aria-controls`→`getElementById` (document-wide fallback removed — worst case is now blank, never
  cross-contaminated); added `isComboboxOpen()`; `openCombobox`/`closeCombobox` now verify their OWN
  menu opened/closed; `fillCombobox` requires `opened` + `ok===true`; `scanUnknownFields` skips `#country`.
- **`bestOptionMatch` ladder rewrite — committed.** exact → leading-clause (comma split: "No, I do not
  have a disability" → "No") → answer⊂option (**shortest** wins, fixes "United States" → "…- Alabama") →
  option⊂answer(≥4) → token-overlap. Forward-substring needs ≥3 chars (stops "No" ⊂ "Lebanon").
- **Consent-checkbox fill — IMPLEMENTED** (`tickConsentCheckboxes`, `autofill.js:315`, wired into the run
  at `:455`). Ticks boxes that gate Submit: trigger is `required` (a required box before Submit is consent
  by definition), keyword match is a bonus; marketing skipped UNLESS required; never clicks Submit;
  reported in `report.consent`. Native `<input type=checkbox>` via `.click()`, custom `role=checkbox` via
  synthetic mouse events. This was the prior cutoff's blocked "immediate ask".
- **`candidate-location` async type-ahead — IMPLEMENTED** (`typeAheadOptions` + `pickLocationOption`,
  `autofill.js` ~`:195`). Types the city clause to trigger the remote load, polls ~2.6s for real options,
  then a location-aware pick (city + full state, longest match). **No city match → leaves it blank by
  design** (never a blind first-pick — that would re-introduce the wrong-menu bug). Was "deferred #3".
- **`popup.js` `localResolveField`** — `/country/` rule guarded against work-status/eligibility labels
  (status|eligib|visa|sponsor|citizen|authoriz|permanent resident|refugee|work permit → route to AI);
  country answer state-qualified `"United States of America - New Jersey"`.
- **`server/data/profile.js`** — `contact.linkedinUrl` fixed (committed).

**Unverified / open:**
- Live-on-real-form confirmation of **checkbox-tick** and **async location** is not recorded in these
  notes — both are coded and the "96%" commit implies close, but **confirm on the next real Greenhouse run.**
- Debug logs still in `autofill.js` (`[Jobby] combobox-debug`, `fill-debug`, `typeahead`,
  `checkbox-skip`/`checkbox-tick`, per-field). **Strip once checkbox + location are confirmed live.**

**Runtime data already accruing:** `server/data/applications.json` = 26 per-app records
(`jobUrl, status, mode, resumeUrl, changesMade, coverageReport`). This is the V4 dashboard foundation —
but `coverageReport` is still **field-names-only** (`filled`/`skipped`/`consent` arrays), NOT yet the
per-field `{ label, value, source, status }` the audit table needs.

**Deploy/test state:**
- Extension (`autofill.js`, `popup.js`): **reload extension** only.
- Server: HEAD is pushed; VPS needs `cd ~/Jobby && git pull && pm2 restart all`.

**Next up (priority order):**
1. **Verify checkbox + async location live** on a real Greenhouse form → then strip the debug logs.
2. **Dashboard groundwork (V4)** — enrich `coverageReport` from field-names-only to per-field
   `{ label, value, source: adapter|local|ai, status }`. Foundation for the audit table + feedback loop:
   user wants to review/correct non-standard fills and save them as profile defaults ("not every fill is
   exactly how I'd want it"). Proposed app record:
   `{ id, appliedAt, jobUrl, platform, company, jobTitle, resumeUrl, tailoring, fields[], counts }`.
   Analytics: coverage rate, most-blank labels, local-vs-AI hit rate, per-platform.
3. True multi-VALUE fill ("select all that apply") — single pick only. Deferred.
4. `lever.json` / `ashby.json` adapters; `automation/` Playwright stubs (V3 hands-off submit).

**Local harness** (`.harness/`, untracked) validates react-select mechanics only — it greenlit two
passes that died on the real form. **The real-form test is the only source of truth.**

---

**Background that still holds (from earlier M3 / AI-fallback / Claude-migration work):**
- **Flow:** `scanUnknownFields` (autofill.js) → `localResolveField` (popup.js, ~75% of fields with ZERO
  API: demographics, yes/no, salary, location, acks) → Claude `POST /ai-resolve-field` only for
  open-ended, batched 3-at-a-time, job description passed as `contextHtml`. The local pre-resolver is
  what killed the **429 TPM** errors.
- **AI** = `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` via `@anthropic-ai/sdk` for both tailoring (`groqService.js`) and
  field resolution (`ai-fallback.js`). ~$0.043/app. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` lives in `server/.env`.
- **profile.js** holds demographics + 90+ `defaultAnswers` + `bio`/`projects` (PPST, Jobby, Are You
  Hungry) for open-ended "tell me about yourself / why this company" questions.
- **Resume upload** uses the `#resume` selector (not `input[name='resume']`) via DataTransfer — confirmed live.
- **Reliability upgrade option** if synthetic events ever prove flaky: drive react-select via React
  fiber/props (Simplify-style, trusted-event-free). That's also the V3 Playwright path → fully hands-off fill+submit.

## Deployment
```bash
# From local
git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push

# On VPS
cd ~/Jobby && git pull && pm2 restart all && pm2 logs
```

## Future Modules (keep in mind when editing)
- **V2 extension/** — content script POSTs JD to this same backend, same `/tailor-resume` endpoint
- **V3 automation/** — Playwright service will live here, separate from Express server, own PM2 process
- **V3 cron/** — job board scrapers, will call same tailoring pipeline programmatically
- **V4 dashboard/** — reads `resumeData` and application tracking data, likely React frontend
- Don't couple new code to Express internals — services should stay independently callable

## V2 Build Notes & Gotchas

- GET /profile needs API key protection — add x-api-key header check,
  same JOBBY_API_KEY in .env, don't expose profile data openly
- CORS must allow chrome-extension:// origins — add to Express CORS config
  before first extension test or requests will silently fail
- Adapter selectors go stale — if a selector matches 0 elements on page,
  flag as "stale" in coverage report, not "unknown"
- Supabase signed URLs expire in 1hr — for V3 compatibility store a
  permanent public URL or VPS path alongside the signed URL
- Use the AI model (Claude) for unknown field resolution instead of keyword matching —
  more resilient to varied phrasing across job boards
- DataTransfer file upload is finicky — test on real Greenhouse page
  before considering it done
- Don't build autofill logic into the extension — keep it as a VPS service
  the extension calls so V3 reuses the same service headlessly
