# Jobby — Claude Code Context

## What Jobby Is
AI-powered job application automation system. Personal use only for now.
Target: reduce per-application time from 20-30 mins to under 60 seconds.

## Current Phase
**V1 — AI Resume Tailoring** (active)
- V2 → Chrome Extension + Autofill
- V3 → Playwright browser automation + cron job scraper
- V4 → Dashboard + analytics

---

## Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js, Express
- **AI:** Groq API — model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, temp `0.15`
- **PDF:** Puppeteer + Chromium
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage, bucket `Resumes` (capital R)
- **Process manager:** PM2
- **VPS:** Hetzner, Ubuntu, root access (root@178.105.161.45)
- **Deployment:** Local → GitHub → SSH → git pull → pm2 restart

---

## File Structure
```
Jobby/
  server/
    routes/
      tailor.js          ← POST /tailor-resume, orchestrates the 3-step pipeline
    services/
      groqService.js     ← Groq AI tailoring logic + resumeData (source of truth)
      pdfService.js      ← Puppeteer HTML → PDF buffer renderer
      uploadService.js   ← Supabase Storage upload → signed URL
    templates/
      resume.html        ← ATS-safe single-column HTML resume template
    server.js            ← Express setup, body parsers, route mounting
    .env                 ← PORT, GROQ_API_KEY, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  extension/             ← V2, not built yet
  automation/            ← V3, not built yet (Playwright, cron jobs)
  dashboard/             ← V4, not built yet
```

## Architecture Rules
- `resumeData` in `groqService.js` is the **single source of truth** for all resume content.
  PDF generation, future dashboard, and extension all consume it from here. Never duplicate it.
- The pipeline is always: Groq tailoring → PDF generation → Supabase upload → return signed URL
- Each step has its own service file. Routes only orchestrate — no business logic in `tailor.js`
- Activities/Leadership section is static — Groq does not tailor it, pdfService renders it directly

---

## Naming Conventions

### Files & Folders
- Service files: `camelCase` + `Service.js` suffix — e.g. `groqService.js`, `pdfService.js`
- Route files: flat noun — e.g. `tailor.js`, future: `scraper.js`, `autofill.js`
- Template files: flat noun — e.g. `resume.html`
- Future extension files go in `extension/`
- Future Playwright/cron files go in `automation/`

### Functions
- Builder functions (pdfService): `build` prefix — e.g. `buildSkillsBlock()`, `buildExperienceBlock()`
- Service entry points: verb + noun — e.g. `tailorResume()`, `generateResumePdf()`, `uploadResume()`
- Prompt builders: `buildPrompt()`

### Variables
- Structured data objects: descriptive nouns — `resumeData`, `tailored`, `pdfBuffer`
- HTML chunks: `*Html` suffix — e.g. `bulletHtml`, `stackLine`
- Always destructure at the top of functions — don't dot-chain deep inline

---

## Comment Style
- **Section dividers:** `// ─── Section Name ───...` (use the box-drawing dash, not regular dash)
- **Inline comments:** one space after `//`, sentence case, no period
  - Good: `// required on Linux VPS`
  - Bad: `//required on linux vps.`
- **Block explanations** (above a function or non-obvious block): one line max, explains *why* not *what*
  - Good: `// Puppeteer launch is expensive, fail fast if template is missing`
  - Bad: `// This checks if the file exists`
- **TODO comments:** `// TODO: short description` — keep them specific
- **Never leave commented-out code** unless it has a `// TODO:` explaining why it's kept

---

## Prompt Rules (groqService.js)
These are non-negotiable — never relax them:
1. Never invent bullets, roles, companies, or metrics
2. Never change any number — preserve exactly as written
3. `skillsToAdd` = clean tool names only. No compound phrases, no descriptors.
   Banned suffixes: "design", "workflow", "management", "RESTful", "practices", "principles"
4. Bullets reworded only — keywords woven into the middle, never appended as "and..." clauses at the end
5. Summary = max 2 sentences, one real metric, no filler words
6. Warnings = max 4 items, max 12 words each

---

## Active Issues (V1)
- Groq still appending "and..." keyword clauses to bullet ends — prompt needs to be harder on this
- `changesMade` field not yet added to Groq response shape
- Resume still spilling to 2 pages on some JDs — padding/font tuning ongoing

---

## Deployment
```bash
# From local
git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push

# On VPS
cd ~/Jobby && git pull && pm2 restart all && pm2 logs
```

## Future Modules (keep in mind when editing)
- **V2 extension/** — content script POSTs JD to this same backend, same `/tailor-resume` endpoint
- **V3 automation/** — Playwright service will live here, separate from Express server, own PM2 process
- **V3 cron/** — job board scrapers, will call same tailoring pipeline programmatically
- **V4 dashboard/** — reads `resumeData` and application tracking data, likely React frontend
- Don't couple new code to Express internals — services should stay independently callable
