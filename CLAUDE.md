# Jobby — Claude Code Context

## What Jobby Is
AI-powered job application automation system. Personal use only for now.
Target: reduce per-application time from 20-30 mins to under 60 seconds.

## Current Phase
**V2 — Chrome Extension + Autofill** (active)
- V1 → AI Resume Tailoring ✅ complete
- V3 → Playwright browser automation + cron job scraper
- V4 → Dashboard + analytics

---

## Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js, Express
- **AI:** Groq API — model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, temp `0.15`
- **PDF:** Puppeteer + Chromium
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage, bucket `Resumes` (capital R)
- **Process manager:** PM2
- **VPS:** Hetzner, Ubuntu, root access (root@178.105.161.45)
- **Deployment:** Local → GitHub → SSH → git pull → pm2 restart

## Architecture Rules
- `resumeData` in `groqService.js` is the **single source of truth** for all resume content.
  PDF generation, future dashboard, and extension all consume it from here. Never duplicate it.
- The pipeline is always: Groq tailoring → PDF generation → Supabase upload → return signed URL
- Each step has its own service file. Routes only orchestrate — no business logic in `tailor.js`
- Activities/Leadership section is static — Groq does not tailor it, pdfService renders it directly

---

## Naming Conventions

### Files & Folders
- Service files: `camelCase` + `Service.js` suffix — e.g. `groqService.js`, `pdfService.js`
- Route files: flat noun — e.g. `tailor.js`, future: `scraper.js`, `autofill.js`
- Template files: flat noun — e.g. `resume.html`
- Future extension files go in `extension/`
- Future Playwright/cron files go in `automation/`

### Functions
- Builder functions (pdfService): `build` prefix — e.g. `buildSkillsBlock()`, `buildExperienceBlock()`
- Service entry points: verb + noun — e.g. `tailorResume()`, `generateResumePdf()`, `uploadResume()`
- Prompt builders: `buildPrompt()`

### Variables
- Structured data objects: descriptive nouns — `resumeData`, `tailored`, `pdfBuffer`
- HTML chunks: `*Html` suffix — e.g. `bulletHtml`, `stackLine`
- Always destructure at the top of functions — don't dot-chain deep inline

---

## Comment Style
- **Section dividers:** `// ─── Section Name ───...` (use the box-drawing dash, not regular dash)
- **Inline comments:** one space after `//`, sentence case, no period
  - Good: `// required on Linux VPS`
  - Bad: `//required on linux vps.`
- **Block explanations** (above a function or non-obvious block): one line max, explains *why* not *what*
  - Good: `// Puppeteer launch is expensive, fail fast if template is missing`
  - Bad: `// This checks if the file exists`
- **TODO comments:** `// TODO: short description` — keep them specific
- **Never leave commented-out code** unless it has a `// TODO:` explaining why it's kept

---

## Prompt Rules (groqService.js)
These are non-negotiable — never relax them:
1. Never invent bullets, roles, companies, or metrics
2. Never change any number — preserve exactly as written
3. `skillsToAdd` = clean tool names only. No compound phrases, no descriptors.
   Banned suffixes: "design", "workflow", "management", "RESTful", "practices", "principles"
4. Bullets reworded only — keywords woven into the middle, never appended as "and..." clauses at the end
5. Summary = max 2 sentences, one real metric, no filler words
6. Warnings = max 4 items, max 12 words each

---

## Active Issues (V1)
- Groq still appending "and..." keyword clauses to bullet ends — prompt needs to be harder on this
- Resume still spilling to 2 pages on some JDs — padding/font tuning ongoing

---

## Current Build Status

### V1 — Complete
- POST /tailor-resume endpoint ✅
- Groq tailoring with prompt rules ✅
- Keyword injection into skills ✅
- Inline tech swaps in bullets ✅
- changesMade field in response ✅
- Puppeteer PDF — single page, ATS-safe ✅
- Activities & Leadership section ✅
- Supabase upload + signed URL ✅
- Chrome extension — scrape, tailor, download ✅
- Popup state persistence ✅
- Coverage gaps warnings ✅

### V2 — In Progress

**Server (complete)**
- [x] server/data/profile.js — profileData object
- [x] server/routes/profile.js — GET /profile (x-api-key protected)
- [x] server/routes/adapters.js — GET /adapters + GET /adapter
- [x] server/routes/apply.js — POST /apply
- [x] server/routes/ai-fallback.js — POST /ai-resolve-field (Groq fallback)
- [x] server/services/apiKeyAuth.js — middleware, JOBBY_API_KEY in .env
- [x] server/server.js — all V2 routes mounted with auth
- [x] CORS — chrome-extension:// origins allowed via cors({ origin: true })
- [x] server/data/adapters/greenhouse.json — field selectors for Greenhouse ATS
- [ ] server/data/adapters/lever.json — not yet written
- [ ] server/data/adapters/ashby.json — not yet written

**Extension (mostly complete)**
- [x] extension/manifest.json — MV3, service worker, permissions
- [x] extension/popup.html — autofill button + coverage UI
- [x] extension/popup.js — autofill trigger + state persistence
- [x] extension/content.js — JD scraping + DOM interaction
- [x] extension/background.js — service worker / message routing
- [x] extension/config.js — VPS URL + shared constants
- [x] extension/cache/ — profile.js, adapters.js, history.js caching layer
- [ ] extension/autofill.js — DOM execution layer (the actual field-fill logic)
- [ ] extension/manifest.json — declare autofill.js as content_script (not done yet)

**Automation stubs (not started)**
- [ ] automation/autofill/index.js — V3 Playwright stub
- [ ] automation/autofill/session.js — V3 cookie management stub

### Last Session Cutoff
**Date:** 2026-05-23

**Done this session:** Built M2 — extension cache layer. Created `extension/config.js` (API_BASE + API_KEY), `extension/cache/profile.js`, `extension/cache/adapters.js`, `extension/cache/history.js`. Updated `popup.html` with platform badge (outside all state divs, visible in all states) and already-applied warning (inside idle state). Updated `popup.js` to show platform badge, already-applied warning, and fire background version checks on every popup open. Committed as `bfaed71`.

**What's missing / next up:**
1. Run 5 M2 tests in Chrome (see test instructions in the M2 commit conversation) — ALL require Chrome on your machine
2. `extension/autofill.js` — the DOM execution layer that reads adapter selectors and fills fields on the page (M3)
3. Declare `autofill.js` as a `content_scripts` entry in `extension/manifest.json` (M3)
4. `server/data/adapters/lever.json` and `ashby.json` — field selector maps for Lever and Ashby ATS
5. `automation/` stubs — low priority, only needed when starting V3

**Known risk:** DataTransfer file upload for resume attach is finicky — test on a real Greenhouse page before calling it done.

---

## Deployment
```bash
# From local
git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push

# On VPS
cd ~/Jobby && git pull && pm2 restart all && pm2 logs
```

---

## Future Modules (keep in mind when editing)
- **V2 extension/** — content script POSTs JD to this same backend, same `/tailor-resume` endpoint
- **V3 automation/** — Playwright service will live here, separate from Express server, own PM2 process
- **V3 cron/** — job board scrapers, will call same tailoring pipeline programmatically
- **V4 dashboard/** — reads `resumeData` and application tracking data, likely React frontend
- Don't couple new code to Express internals — services should stay independently callable

## V2 Build Notes & Gotchas

- GET /profile needs API key protection — add x-api-key header check,
  same JOBBY_API_KEY in .env, don't expose profile data openly
- CORS must allow chrome-extension:// origins — add to Express CORS config
  before first extension test or requests will silently fail
- Adapter selectors go stale — if a selector matches 0 elements on page,
  flag as "stale" in coverage report, not "unknown"
- Supabase signed URLs expire in 1hr — for V3 compatibility store a
  permanent public URL or VPS path alongside the signed URL
- Use Groq for unknown field resolution instead of keyword matching —
  more resilient to varied phrasing across job boards
- DataTransfer file upload is finicky — test on real Greenhouse page
  before considering it done
- Don't build autofill logic into the extension — keep it as a VPS service
  the extension calls so V3 reuses the same service headlessly
